# Login Authentication System  

This is a **secure login authentication system** designed to restrict access to specific sections of a website, ensuring that only authorized users can proceed. By integrating front-end and back-end technologies, this system handles authentication securely and efficiently.

## Tech Stack  

- **HTML**: Structure for login and restricted access pages.  
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and professional user interface.  
- **JavaScript**: Front-end validation and dynamic functionality.  
- **Back-end Technology**: Node.js, PHP, or Python for secure server-side logic.

## Features  

- **User Authentication & Session Management**:  
  Authenticate users and manage sessions to ensure secure access throughout their browsing session.  

- **Secure Password Storage & Validation**:  
  - Passwords are securely stored using robust hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).  
  - Prevent unauthorized access by validating credentials securely.  

- **User Roles & User Access Control**:  
  - Implement basic role-based access control.  
  - Different levels of access based on user privileges (e.g., admin, user).

## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.  
2. Set up the back-end environment:  
   - If using **Node.js**: Install dependencies using `npm install`.  
   - If using **PHP** or **Python**, configure the server and dependencies accordingly.  
3. Update the configuration file with your database credentials.  
4. Run the back-end server:  
   - Node.js: `node server.js`  
   - PHP: Use a local server (e.g., XAMPP or WAMP).  
   - Python: Use frameworks like Flask or Django.  
5. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to test the login system.

## Screenshots  

Include screenshots of the login page, error handling messages, and restricted pages (if available).

## Security Highlights  

- **Password Hashing**: Ensures sensitive user information is never stored in plain text.  
- **Session Tokens**: Protect user sessions from unauthorized access.  
- **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks by sanitizing user input.
